This is an exmple about how to use the mpmath to take high-precision calculation for the non-Hermtiain systems.

Following are topics that we are interested in:

1.  eigenvalues and eigenstates.
2.  the statistics of the eigenvalues and eigenstates.
3.  quantum dynamics for the non-Hermitian system.
4.  multiprocessing calculation.
